# TicTacToe (Single Method Version)

This project is part of my backend learning journey in Java.  
I built a simple **TicTacToe board game** step by step, keeping the code short and clean.

## ✨ Features
- 3x3 board created using `char[][]`.
- Players X and O take turns entering row and column positions.
- Board updates after each move.
- Win condition checks (rows, columns, diagonals).
- Stops immediately when a winner is found.

## 🎯 Notes
- This is the **single method version**: all logic is inside `main`.
- Later, I will refactor into multiple methods for clarity and reuse.

## 🌱 Learning Scroll
This project is part of my radiant backend journey:
- Step 1: Board creation  
- Step 2: Hardcoded moves  
- Step 3: Interactive input (this version)  
- Step 4: Win condition checks (coming soon!)
